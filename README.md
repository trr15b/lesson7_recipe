### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned how tags can be used to fix a majority of the problems we have be having with calling functions and how the append feature can be used to add information.
2. We learned how to work with elements and to pull information from diffrent files by linking the two together with code.
3. We learned how elements in a dynamic page can be hidden and revealed without having to change the whole page and that is what makes a dynamic page fundamentally different from a static page.
